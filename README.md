## 1.  INTRODUCTION

chart-extensions is a free Java class library with a single purpose: To extend the JfreeChart library so that the needs in project Loadcoder are met. This is done by:

 * Fixing bugs in the JFreeChart library. The reason why bugs are fixed here is because project Loadcoder is on a specific release of JFreeChart. In order to have bugs fixed within a resonable time period, bugs will be fixed and released here simultaneously with new releases of Loadcoder. These bugs may also be reported to and fixed in the JFreeChart project.
 
 * Extending the JFreeChart library in a way that is beneficial for project Loadcoder, but probably out of scope for project JFreeChart.


chart-extensions is licensed, free of charge, under the terms of the GNU Lesser
General Public Licence, version 2.1 or later.
